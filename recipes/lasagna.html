      <li>
        Add onions and garlic to the skillet and sauté until they are softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and tomato paste. Stir well
        and simmer for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, parsley, salt, and
        pepper. Mix until well blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly
        overlapping them.
      </li>
      <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
      <li>Add a layer of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Finish with a final layer of noodles, meat sauce, and a generous amount
        of cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes until the cheese
        is bubbly and golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the lasagna to cool for 10-15 minutes before serving to set and
        enhance the flavors.
