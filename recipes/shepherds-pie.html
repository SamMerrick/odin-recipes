      <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.</li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Add frozen mixed vegetables (such as peas, carrots, and corn) to the

        heated through.

        potatoes until tender.

      <li>Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.</li>
      <li>

      <li>Transfer the meat and vegetable mixture to a baking dish.</li>
      <li>
        Spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the meat mixture, creating a top
        layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a fork to create decorative ridges on the surface of the mashed
        potatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the Shepherd's Pie in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or

        serving.
